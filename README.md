# asteroseismology-outreach
This repository hosts two types of thing:

1. Resources that I find myself reusing when presenting science: both for public outreach, and introductory/review type talks.
2. Slides and posters that I have presented at previous conferences.

In future, I will add notebooks used to produce the more fiddly plots.
